ABILITIES

  * phase shifting

  Allows the character to be temporarily out of harm from any dangers which
  would otherwise hurt or kill the character. In this state, the character has
  limited sensory input and almost no ability to affect or communicate with
  the physical world. However, the character can communicate with other
  characters in the same phase.

ENERGY

  Energy is the primary resource used by players. It can be either stored in
  energy cells (such as batteries) or channeled in the following ways:
  
  * defensive

  When channeled into shields or body armor, energy increases the character's
  tolerance to heat, cold, radiation and impact.

  * offensive

  When channeled into weapons, energy increases firepower.

  * sensory

  When channeled into sensory implants, scanners, radars or flashlights, energy
  increases range and effectiveness.
